     2 - 1 year embargo
     3 - 2 year embargo
     4 - flexible delayed release
	   Note: 	if embargo code = 4  
			sales_restriction 1 (seperately in the XML) should be populated. The corresponding "remove" attribute should 
			have the delayed release date chosen by the author/administrator.In case the author chooses to never release 
			his/her work the corresponding "remove" date on the restriction should be null.
  Examples: embargo_code = 4, Diss_sales_restriction = 1, remove = 01/01/2010 (delayed release until 01/01/2010)
		embargo_code = 4, Diss_sales_restriction = 1, remove = null	      (never to be released)

  Diss_sales_restriction need not be populated for embargo options 1,2 and 3 since the release date is implied.
